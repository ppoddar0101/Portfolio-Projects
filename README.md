This project was used to predict the Next Hit in Spotify through a dataset from Kaggle. Streams was my target variable. 
This repository consists of the Google Colab code as well as a final report with descriptions for every part of the code. 
This is the dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/top-spotify-songs-2023
